# GGR472: Lab 4
 
This repository contains the code for an integrated webmap using MapBox Studio, MapBox GL JS, and Turf.js.

It explores the locations of road collisions involving pedestrians or cyclists in Toronto between 2006 and 2021 [Toronto 2023](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/motor-vehicle-collisions-involving-killed-or-seriously-injured-persons/). They are represented both as individual points as well as cumulations represented in hexagons.
